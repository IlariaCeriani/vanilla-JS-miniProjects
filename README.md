# vanilla-JS-miniProjects  
## What are these?  
All these folders contain very simple JS projects I'm building to get familiar with JS. It's basically my training ground.  
## Are you building all these projects form scratch?  
Yes, I'm taking inspiration from certain FreeCodeCamp tutorials but I'm giving them a more personal twist..
